# pupil-pthreads-win

This is a precompiled version of pthreads for windows wrapped in a python package.
We use it as dependency for various modules for the pupil core software.

This wrapper contains a x64 precompiled version of pthreads-win 2.9.1 from https://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/ from Ross Johnson.
The original licensing information can be found in [COPYING](src/pupil_pthreads_win/data/COPYING) and [COPYING.LIB](src/pupil_pthreads_win/data/COPYING.LIB).

## Installation
